  	<title>Day Before School</title>
  	<description>It's the day before [AT]'s first day of school in his new living arrangement with Uncle Harry and Auntie Gina.
  	Dad is off to war. Mom is in school and cannot support him at this time. Might not need to be that specific. It's 2pm, and [AT] and [his] auntie and uncle have just had a quiet lunch after church. You are in control of [AT]'s actions for 10 weeks. Through the actions you choose, you will determine possible futures for [AT]. What should [he] do now?</description>
